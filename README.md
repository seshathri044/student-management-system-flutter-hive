# 🎓 Student Management System (Flutter + Hive DB)

A beautiful and responsive **Flutter** application to manage student records by class. This app allows users to select a class (10th, 11th, 12th), view, add, edit, and delete student records using **Hive DB** for local data persistence. Designed with modular and scalable code for mobile and web platforms.

 ```
### 📌 Highlights:
Data Layer → Hive DB (local storage)
Domain Layer → Use cases (add, update, delete, fetch students)
Presentation Layer → Clean UI with Flutter

## ✨ Features

✅ Structured with **Clean Architecture** (data → domain → presentation)
✅ Robust input validation & error handling (empty fields, duplicate roll numbers, etc.)
✅ Dependency Injection (InjectionContainer) for scalable architecture
✅ Repository pattern for clean data access
✅ **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** – automated build & test on every push
✅ Ready for unit tests with a dedicated test/ folder

### 📦 Hive Database 
*🐝 Used Hive for lightweight local database
*Created a Student model with @HiveType and @HiveField
*Registered adapters during app initialization
*Performed full CRUD operations:
*Add student
*View list of students
*Edit student details
*Delete student
*Each class (10th/11th/12th) stores data in a different Hive box
